# Booths-Multiplication-Algorithm-Simulation

This is a simulation Booth's multiplication algorithm which performs 16 bit multiplication. This simulation simulates a 1 bit ALU and 16 bit ALU as subcomponents to Booths multiplication Algorithm. This program also simulates MD, AC, MQ, all 16 bit.

To use this program, run it and enter two 16 digit binary numbers. One will be for MD, the other for MQ. The program will run and show you the steps taken in the algorithm to produce a 32 bit answer using Booths Multiplication Algorithm
